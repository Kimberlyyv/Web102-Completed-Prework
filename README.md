## Notes

One challenge I faced was debugging the filtering functionality for the "Show Funded Only" and "Show Unfunded Only" buttons. Initially, the logic did not correctly update the displayed list of games, but after carefully reviewing the JavaScript code, I identified and fixed a typo in the conditional statement.

Another challenge was styling the app. Finding the right CSS properties to align and center the elements took longer than expected, but experimenting with Flexbox eventually resolved the issue.
